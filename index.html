    <p><strong>Spicy Gongura Paneer | How to make Gongura Paneer Curry</strong>- Usually, when we think of Paneer, we think Punjabi recipes. But not this one. It is a spicy, sour Curry that goes very well with Rotis.

    <p>The idea for this recipe was born during wedding meals. I was once served Gongura Pickle, a regular favourite for Andhras, and some Paneer Kurma. I finished the Gravy in the Kurma and had some Paneer cubes left on my plate. Then, I just added those Cubes to the classic combination of Gongura and hot rice and found that it tasted amazing. So, I worked a little bit on this novel combination and found that people really loved the taste. And that is how I shot the recipe and posted it. Just check it out!</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>Use this type of Gongura:
    </h3>
    <ol type="1" start="1">
        <li>
            Tender Gongura Leaves are good for this curry. In Telugu Cuisine, it is usually Old, seasoned Gongura leaves that are used for pickles and Rice. If the leaves are not tender, they turn into stringy fibre in this Paneer Curry.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Gongura turns sticky if you do not do this:
    </h3>
    <ol type="1" start="2">
        <li>
            We need adequate Oil for Gongura Paneer. Only then it tastes good. If the Oil isn’t sufficient, then the leaves turn sticky.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Do this to get a great taste:
    </h3>
    <ol type="1" start="3">
        <li>The sliced Green Chillies that we add to the Curry are spicy but turn nicely sour when soaked in Gongura base.</li>
        <li>Soak Paneer for 10 minutes in hot water before adding to the Curry to make it soft. And it will be able to soak in all the flavours nicely.</li>
    </ol>
